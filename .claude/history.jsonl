{"display":"This workspace is a public project to write a novel with input from J Wynia's social media community via LLM agent. It does not yet have a context network initialized and needs one. Details on that pattern are in @inbox/context-network-guide.md. The README has a tiny blurb in it about how this project came to be. For now, I just want to initialize a context network with information already provided. We'll expand from there.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1767309502126,"project":"/workspaces/the-kepler-testimonies","sessionId":"72ebb5cf-5b99-408c-b10a-33a31f1169d5"}

{"display":"This project is run via the github project at https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies. We should work in branches and put in PRs for work we do on the novel. Decisions that the human group should make go up as polls on github. Work items we identify that need to be worked on later and not in the immediate session should be logged as github issues. The discussions should be used for announcements, etc. The gh cli is logged in and should be used for github activity. All of this should be documented into the context network as part of our working process rules.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1767310181698,"project":"/workspaces/the-kepler-testimonies","sessionId":"e8ddadb0-5304-469a-a90f-2e3161a03fdf"}
