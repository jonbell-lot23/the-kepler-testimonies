# Decision 003: Foundation Choices (Vessel, Impossibility, Structure)

Director decision to break tied community votes on the Kepler's nature and impossibility mechanism, plus establish the novel's structural approach.

## Decision Type

- [ ] Community Vote
- [x] Director Decision
- [ ] Creative Decision (AI)
- [ ] Technical Decision

## Summary

The Kepler is a **deep-space waystation** (The Stopover), the 12 impossible testimonies involve **mundane details that can't all be true** (The Agreement Problem), and the novel structure is **investigation-driven** (not a testimony catalog).

## Context

Community votes on GitHub Discussions for both foundational questions ended in ties:
- **Discussion #9**: What is the Kepler? (Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
- **Discussion #8**: What makes 12 testimonies impossible? (Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)

Per the governance framework, ties escalate to Director Decision (Tier 3). Additionally, the structural approach needed clarification to prevent the novel from becoming an unreadable catalog.

## Options Considered

### Vessel Type
1. **The Failed Mission** - Decommissioned diplomatic station, bureaucratic close-out crew
2. **The Lifeboat** - Emergency evacuation pod from larger catastrophe, survival narrative
3. **The Stopover** - Deep-space waystation, random cross-section of travelers

### Impossibility Type
1. **Absent Witnesses** - Testimonies from people with verified alibis elsewhere
2. **Document Anomaly** - Testimonies impossible as physical documents
3. **Agreement Problem** - Testimonies that disagree about objective trivial details

### Structure
- Epistolary catalog (500 testimony documents)
- Investigation-driven narrative (protagonist investigator, testimonies as evidence)

## Decision

### 1. Vessel Type: The Stopover
The Kepler is a deep-space waystation—a refueling depot and rest stop on a major transit route. Not a destination, not a vessel with a mission. Just infrastructure. The 500 testimonies come from everyone who happened to be there when it vanished: travelers, station staff, cargo haulers, families on vacation, business travelers, a touring musician between gigs.

### 2. Impossibility Type: The Agreement Problem
The 12 impossible testimonies describe trivial details that should be objective and aren't:
- Same clock shows different times to different observers simultaneously
- Same hallway measures both 12m and 15m (architectural plans confirm both)
- Maintenance logs record the same repair in two locations (physical evidence in both)

Reality was inconsistent at the level of coffee times and hallway lengths—not apocalyptic moments.

### 3. Structure: Investigation-Driven Narrative
The novel is NOT an epistolary catalog of 500 testimonies. It follows a protagonist investigator trying to reconcile the testimonies. Testimonies appear as evidence woven into the investigation. Key testimonies are experienced as scenes, not dry depositions.

### 4. Investigator Arc
Four escalating phases:
1. **Bureaucratic Assignment** - Routine administrative close-out
2. **Personal Connection Emerges** - Discovers someone aboard they knew
3. **Evidence Won't Fit** - The Agreement Problem becomes undeniable
4. **Institutional Pressure** - Pushed to sign off on cover story

## Rationale

**Director's reasoning:**

The Stopover + Agreement Problem combination best serves the project's creative taste (see `context/foundation/taste.md`):

1. **Maximum testimony diversity** - A waystation gives genuinely different people (cargo haulers, vacationing families, touring musicians, station lifers). Each voice can be distinct because they share nothing except location.

2. **Impossibility feels earned** - The Agreement Problem creates strangeness through accumulation, not revelation. This matches the stated preference for grounded, non-arbitrary impossibility.

3. **"All are true" paradox hits hardest here** - Testimonies that disagree about trivial facts while all being demonstrably true is more unsettling than dramatic mystical impossibility. It undermines shared reality itself.

4. **Blue-collar SF without cynicism** - A rest stop is infrastructure. The witnesses aren't heroes or special cases—just people who stopped for fuel. Competent everyday people, not chosen ones.

5. **Reader engagement** - Readers become detectives, spotting when details don't match.

**Structural reasoning:**

An epistolary catalog of 500 testimonies would be unreadable. The investigation frame provides:
- Narrative drive (following a protagonist)
- Emotional stakes (personal connection)
- Natural way to present key testimonies as scenes
- Escalating tension through the arc phases

## Implications

### What this locks in
- The Kepler is infrastructure, not a mission vessel
- Impossibility is mundane, not dramatic
- We need an investigator protagonist
- Testimonies appear within an investigation frame

### What remains open
- **Investigator specifics**: Role, agency, disposition, name
- **Personal connection**: Who was aboard that matters to them
- **Institution**: What agency, what cover story, why suppress
- **Ending**: Does the investigator comply, expose, disappear, or something else
- **The Kepler itself**: Location, how long ago it vanished, what "vanished" means exactly

### What this enables
- Outline development can proceed with clear constraints
- Character work on the investigator can begin
- Scene-level testimony drafting can start (knowing they'll be woven into investigation)

- [001-premise-selection.md](001-premise-selection.md) - Establishes the "500 testimonies, 12 impossible, all true" premise this builds on
- [002-governance-adoption.md](002-governance-adoption.md) - Establishes the Tier 3 Director Decision authority used here

## Status

**Implemented** - These decisions are now the foundation for outline development.
