# The Kepler Testimonies: Storyboard

This document uses the **snowflake method**—each level expands the previous with more detail. Developed through skill-assisted iteration (brainstorming, cliché-transcendence, orthogonality analysis).

## Level 0: One-Sentence Summary

A late-career claims adjuster assigned to reconcile conflicting agency files on a long-closed waystation incident discovers that the discrepancies aren't clerical errors—reality itself was inconsistent—and closes the file anyway.

---

## Level 1: One-Paragraph Summary

Years after the Kepler Stopover incident was "closed," a late-career adjuster is assigned to reconcile the files. Multiple agencies—insurance, station authority, transit regulation, labor board—each closed the case differently. Nobody expects new findings; the job is to align paperwork across jurisdictions so everything can be archived before a merger consumes the department. But comparing the agencies' flagged testimonies reveals something stranger than bureaucratic disagreement: twelve testimonies describe mundane details that can't all be true—clocks showing different times simultaneously, hallways measuring different lengths with plans confirming both. The discrepancies aren't errors. Reality was inconsistent. The adjuster—someone who has never needed existential closure, who has spent a career writing reports that make messy things fit—does what they've always done: writes what can be written, leaves out what can't, closes the file, and goes home. The strangeness is that they're not transformed. They just... continue.

## Level 2: Page Summary

### Beat 1: The Reconciliation Assignment

The Kepler Stopover incident was closed years ago—by multiple agencies, each differently. Insurance paid certain claims and denied others. The station authority issued a report. Transit regulation filed their own findings. The labor board documented worker testimonies separately. Now, with a departmental merger looming, someone needs to reconcile these files so they can be archived together. The adjuster—late-career, mixed record, counting months to retirement—gets the job because it's supposed to be easy. A reconciliation audit. Compare documents. Note discrepancies. Recommend a unified archive format. Nobody expects them to investigate anything. They're just supposed to make the paperwork match.

The adjuster is competent but not exceptional. They've handled difficult cases before—fraud they missed, claims they shouldn't have paid. They're not the best closer in the department; they're just available. The Kepler files are thick, tedious, and everyone else is focused on the merger chaos. This is a backwater assignment for someone already on their way out.

### Beat 2: The Uncomfortable Recognition

Working through witness lists, the adjuster encounters a name they recognize. Not someone they loved—someone they knew once and didn't particularly like. A distant connection. A neighbor's ex-husband, maybe. A former colleague from a job they'd rather forget. Someone they'd recognize at a grocery store but wouldn't invite to dinner.

They read this person's testimony. It's ordinary—a traveler describing a routine layover interrupted by whatever happened. But the adjuster can hear their voice in the words. This was a real person. They remember their laugh, their annoying habits, the last awkward conversation they had.

It shouldn't matter. It's not grief. It's not love. But the adjuster finds themselves reading more carefully now. Cross-referencing. Building timelines. Looking for this person's name in other documents. The testimonies become people, not data.

### Beat 3: The Discrepancy Pattern

Comparing flagged testimonies across agencies, the adjuster notices something odd. Each agency flagged different testimonies as problematic. Insurance flagged four. Regulatory flagged five. Station authority flagged three. There's some overlap, but not complete. The total is twelve, but the *reasons* for flagging don't match.

Looking closer, the discrepancies aren't clerical. Testimony #34 says coffee was served at 0700. Testimony #35 says 0702. Both witnesses were looking at the same clock. Both were certain. Cross-referencing physical evidence shows both times are somehow verified—the clock showed different times to different observers, simultaneously.

A hallway measures 12 meters in some testimonies, 15 in others. Architectural plans confirm both measurements. A maintenance log records a repair at Bay 7; another log records the same repair at Bay 9. Physical evidence exists in both locations.

These aren't transcription errors. Reality was inconsistent at the level of coffee times and hallway lengths. The adjuster starts looking at the 488 "ordinary" testimonies and begins noticing smaller discrepancies that nobody else flagged...

### Beat 4: The Revelation

The adjuster sees it. The pattern clicks. They understand what they're looking at.

The Kepler's reality was genuinely inconsistent. Not transcription errors. Not witness confusion. Reality itself failed to agree with itself. Multiple true things that can't all be true—but are. The Agreement Problem.

This is revelation. This is the mystery solving itself. They figured it out.

The person they recognized—the one whose testimony they kept reading—is one of the twelve impossibles. Their account describes a hallway that measured both lengths. The adjuster knows this person wasn't lying. They know the testimony is accurate. They know it's impossible. They know it's TRUE.

And now they know something no one else knows. Something no one else will believe. Something they can't prove, can't explain, can't share.

Nobody at the department asks questions. Everyone's focused on the merger. The adjuster's supervisor glances at their reconciliation notes, sees "recommend archiving with discrepancy flags," and signs off. No pressure. No cover-up. Just institutional indifference to something that doesn't fit any protocol.

The adjuster has solved the mystery. And there is no one to tell.

### Beat 5: The Aftermath

The adjuster writes their reconciliation report. They note the discrepancies. They recommend archiving with flags for "unresolved witness variance." They know what the flags mean. No one else will.

File boxed. Archive stamp. A nod from the archivist who's processed strange files before and doesn't ask questions. Walk to the car. Drive home.

Dinner. Something stupid on TV. The Kepler was today. Tomorrow is something else.

But they know. They solved it. Reality was broken at the Kepler Stopover, and they're the only person who understands that. The uncomfortable acquaintance—the one whose testimony they kept reading—might have understood. They shared the experience. They might have been someone to talk to.

But they're gone. And even if they weren't, the relationship was never close enough for a conversation like that.

The adjuster carries the answer alone. Not because they failed to find it. Because they found it, and there's no one to tell.

## Level 3: Act Structure

Based on the mystery-honoring direction:

- **Act 1: The Assignment** — Reconciliation audit lands on desk. Merger chaos. Backwater job. The uncomfortable recognition surfaces.
- **Act 2: The Investigation** — Comparing agency files, clues accumulate. The discrepancies form a pattern. The 488 start showing cracks too.
- **Act 3: The Revelation** — The adjuster figures it out. The Agreement Problem is real. Reality was inconsistent. They understand. Mystery solved.
- **Act 4: The Aftermath** — Knowing doesn't change what must be done. File archived. They go home alone with the truth. Tragedy, not anti-climax.

## Thematic Integration

### Genre Commitment

**Primary: Mystery.** The original pitch promises discovery, and we honor that promise. The investigator DOES solve the puzzle.

**Secondary: Literary fiction.** What happens after revelation is where the literary depth lives.

### The Thesis

**Truth can be discovered but not transmitted.**

The investigator solves the mystery—they understand the Agreement Problem is real. That's revelation. That's the mystery working. But understanding doesn't mean anyone will listen. The solution isolates rather than liberates.

### How Each Beat Expresses the Thesis

| Beat | Mystery Function | Literary Function |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **1: Assignment** | Sets up the investigation | Shows institutional context, competent protagonist |
| **2: Recognition** | Personal stakes—this matters to them | The one person who might understand is gone |
| **3: Discrepancy** | Clues accumulate, pattern emerges | The puzzle pieces are mundane impossibilities |
| **4: Revelation** | **The investigator figures it out** | Understanding achieved—but who can they tell? |
| **5: Close** | Mystery solved, case filed | Knowing doesn't change what must be done. Tragedy of carrying truth alone. |

### Key Structural Point

**Beat 4 is REVELATION, not "non-crisis."**

The investigator understands the Agreement Problem is real. Reality was genuinely inconsistent. The testimonies are all true. This is the mystery paying off.

What follows is the literary question: now what? And the answer—file it, go home, carry it alone—is tragedy, not anti-climax.

## Proposed Direction Summary

This storyboard proposes a **mystery with literary depth**:

| Element | Typical Mystery | This Story | Why |
|---------|----------------|------------|-----|
| Investigator | Driven seeker | Late-career, competent | Good enough to solve it; experienced enough to know no one will listen |
| Investigation | Building to revelation | Same—clues accumulate | Mystery structure honored |
| Revelation | Climactic discovery | **Yes—they figure it out** | The Agreement Problem is understood. Mystery payoff delivered. |
| Institution | Antagonist covering up | Indifferent, no category for this | Not evil—just can't receive this kind of truth |
| Personal connection | Lost loved one | Awkward acquaintance, now gone | The one person who might have understood. Tragedy. |
| Ending | Action follows revelation | Quiet aftermath | Knowing doesn't change what must be done. They file it and go home alone. |

**Why this works:**
- Honors the mystery genre promise (discovery, revelation, understanding)
- Adds literary depth (what happens after you solve a mystery no one can hold?)
- The tragedy is that the mystery WORKS—they figure it out, and it doesn't help
- "All are true" is the answer. The investigator understands it. And carries it alone.

## Open Questions for Development

### Now Decided (Proposed)
- **Investigator type**: Late-career adjuster, reconciliation audit specialist
- **Institution stance**: Indifferent, not hostile—focused on merger
- **Arc shape**: Anti-transformation; same person before and after
- **Personal connection**: Distant, uncomfortable acquaintance
- **Ending direction**: Procedural close, life continues

### Still Open
1. **Investigator specifics**: Name, exact role, which agency
2. **The merger**: What agencies are merging? Why does this create the reconciliation audit?
3. **The uncomfortable acquaintance**: Who specifically? What was the relationship?
4. **The archivist**: Character or just a moment? Do they know something?
5. **Kepler specifics**: Location, how long ago, what "vanished" means exactly
6. **Testimony integration**: Which of the 12 impossible testimonies appear as scenes vs. summary?
7. **The 488**: What additional discrepancies does the adjuster find?
