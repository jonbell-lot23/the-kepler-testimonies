# Current Project Status

## Last Updated
2026-01-16

## State
**Thematic Framework Established** - Responding to community feedback, developed thematic thesis: "Institutional competence creates loneliness." All anti-genre choices now have thematic justification, not just craft justification. Storyboard updated with thematic integration. Ready for continued outline expansion.

## What Exists
- Locked premise: "500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true."
- Project structure and context network
- **Story development structure** - Full outline skeleton with meta, outline, elements, and craft sections
- **Storyboard (Levels 0-2)** - High-level arc established ([storyboard.md](../story/outline/storyboard.md))
- **Thematic Framework** - Thesis, organizing principle, and reader contract ([thematic-framework.md](../story/thematic-framework.md))
- **Snowflake workflow** - Expansion process documented ([snowflake-workflow.md](../story/outline/snowflake-workflow.md))
- **Automatic skill invocation** - CLAUDE.md configured for skill triggers during outline work
- Community participation channels (GitHub Discussions)
- Foundation documents for creative taste and success criteria
- Concept brainstorm with voting options ([concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md](../story/concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md))
- **Foundation decisions resolved:**
  - **Vessel Type**: The Stopover (deep-space waystation)
  - **Impossibility Type**: The Agreement Problem (mundane details that can't all be true)
  - **Structure**: Investigation-driven narrative (NOT testimony catalog)
  - **Investigator Arc**: Bureaucratic assignment → personal connection → evidence won't fit → institutional pressure
  - **Thematic Thesis**: Institutional competence creates loneliness

## What's Next
1. ~~Community votes on Kepler type + impossibility mechanism~~ Resolved (tied votes, Director decision)
2. ~~Begin outline development~~ Storyboard L0-L2 complete
3. **Expand storyboard to Level 3** (Act Structure) using `/outline-collaborator`
4. Develop investigator character specifics (name, role, agency)
5. Design testimony integration—which of the 12 impossible testimonies appear when
6. Answer open questions: personal connection, institution, ending

## Decision Status

### Open Questions for Outline Development
- **Who is the investigator?** Role, agency, disposition
- **What's the personal connection?** Who was aboard that matters to them
- **What's the institution?** What agency, what cover story, why suppress
- **What's the ending?** Comply, expose, disappear, or something else
- **The Kepler station**: Location, how long ago, what "vanished" means

### Recently Resolved
- **Decision 003**: Foundation choices → Stopover + Agreement Problem + Investigation structure (Director decision, tie-breaker)
- **Decision 002**: Governance adoption → Formal governance framework implemented
- **Decision 001**: Premise selection → THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected

## Recent Activity

### 2026-01-16
- **Thematic framework established** - Responding to community feedback about missing thematic/meta-organizational level
  - **Diagnosis**: Used `/story-sense` to identify State 5 (Plot Without Purpose)—structure exists but thematic question unanswered
  - **Core insight**: Anti-genre choices were craft decisions looking for thematic justification (cart before horse)
  - **Brainstorm**: Generated 7 divergent thematic thesis options using Escape Velocity Protocol
  - **Selected thesis**: "Institutional competence creates loneliness"—the horror isn't that systems fail, it's that they work so well humans are isolated inside them
  - **Genre framing**: Literary realism (with quiet horror undertones)—aligns with taste preferences for competence and institutional complexity
- **Storyboard updated** - Added thematic integration section showing how each beat expresses the thesis
- **Documents created**:
  - `context/story/thematic-framework.md` - Thesis, organizing principle, reader contract
  - `context/story/explorations/story-sense-diagnosis-2026-01-16.md` - Identified thematic gap
  - `context/story/explorations/thematic-thesis-brainstorm-2026-01-16.md` - 7 thesis options with analysis
- **Key answer to feedback**: Anti-genre choices are now justified thematically ("because this is what the story is about") not just by craft ("because it's fresher")

### 2026-01-12
- **Storyboard initiated** - Snowflake outlining approach adopted
  - Created `storyboard.md` with Levels 0-2 pre-populated from foundation decisions
  - Level 0: One-sentence premise
  - Level 1: One-paragraph summary (5 beats)
  - Level 2: Page summary expanding each beat
  - Levels 3+ to be developed via skill-assisted expansion
- **Snowflake workflow documented** - `snowflake-workflow.md` explains expansion process
- **CLAUDE.md enhanced** - Added Skill Preferences and Automatic Skill Invocation sections
  - Skills now trigger automatically from natural language ("expand this" → `/outline-collaborator`)
  - Organized by domain: Outlining, Ideation, Development, Drafting
- **Branch created**: `feature/storyboard-outline` for PR review
- **Plot arc development** - Full skill-assisted session:
  - Brainstorming: Generated 5 divergent plot arc options
  - Cliché analysis: Assessed risks, identified freshening moves
  - Orthogonality pass: Deepened combination for maximum texture
  - Result: Anti-genre approach (late-career adjuster, reconciliation audit, no transformation, procedural close)
- **Storyboard revised** - Updated L0-L2 with deepened direction, ready for community review

### 2026-01-08
- **Foundation decisions resolved** - Director decision broke tied community votes
  - Vessel: The Stopover (waystation on transit route)
  - Impossibility: The Agreement Problem (mundane details inconsistent)
  - Structure: Investigation-driven (protagonist investigator, not testimony catalog)
  - Arc: Four phases (assignment → personal connection → evidence won't fit → pressure)
- Decision record created: [003-foundation-choices.md](../decisions/003-foundation-choices.md)
- Ready for outline development

### 2026-01-03
- **Outline structure implemented** - Adopted organizational system from another project
  - `story/meta/` - Tagline, premise, synopsis (premise moved from foundation/)
  - `story/outline/` - Structure overview, backlog, issues tracking
  - `story/elements/` - Characters, places, organizations, objects
  - `story/craft/` - Voice decisions, writing choices log
  - `foundation/outline-workflow.md` - System documentation
- **Backlog system ready** - Priority-based issue tracking for story problems
- **Navigation updated** - discovery.md and story/index.md now reflect new structure
### 2026-01-02
- **Foundation documents established** - Created taste.md and ideal-state.md
  - Individual taste entries framework (Director example included)
  - Forced tradeoffs section for explicit creative direction
  - Success criteria and deliverables defined
  - Changelog approach established
  - Both integrated into onboarding workflow
- **Polls created via web UI** - GitHub Discussions polls require manual creation through the web interface (API doesn't support poll options); original emoji-reaction polls and API-created discussions closed
- **Voting format established** - all polls include "none of these" with space for suggestions
- **Cliché transcendence completed** - all moderate-risk options freshened
  - "Embassy" → "Failed Mission" (decommissioning crew, contact arrives while closing)
  - "Witness Problem" → "Absent Witnesses" (people with alibis who were never aboard)
  - "Mutual Exclusion" → "Agreement Problem" (trivial details inconsistent, not dramatic events)
  - "The Chorus" replaced with "The Stopover" (flagged as fantasy/magic)

### 2026-01-01
- **Concept brainstorm completed** using Escape Velocity Protocol
  - 3 options for "What is the Kepler?" (now: Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
  - 3 options for "Impossibility mechanism" (now: Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)
  - Options verified as genuinely divergent (different axes, not variations)
- GitHub workflow documented (branches, PRs, issues, gh CLI)
- Context network initialized
- Foundation documents created
- Decision record for premise selection documented

### December 2025
- Project created after Threads interest check
- Community voted on premise
- THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected

## Blockers
None currently.

## Open Questions
- ~~What is the Kepler?~~ → **RESOLVED**: The Stopover (waystation)
- ~~What makes 12 testimonies "impossible"?~~ → **RESOLVED**: The Agreement Problem (mundane inconsistencies)
- ~~How to structure 500 testimonies for reading/presentation?~~ → **RESOLVED**: Investigation-driven narrative
- Who is the investigator? (role, agency, disposition)
- What's the personal connection? (who was aboard that matters to them)
- What's the institution? (what agency, what cover story, why suppress)
- What's the ending? (comply, expose, disappear, or something else)
- What does "vanished" mean exactly? How long ago? Did it reappear?
