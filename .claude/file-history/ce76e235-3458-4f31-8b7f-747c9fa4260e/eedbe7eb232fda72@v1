# The Kepler Testimonies: Storyboard

This document uses the **snowflake method**—each level expands the previous with more detail. Developed through skill-assisted iteration (brainstorming, cliché-transcendence, orthogonality analysis).

---

## Level 0: One-Sentence Summary

A late-career claims adjuster assigned to reconcile conflicting agency files on a long-closed waystation incident discovers that the discrepancies aren't clerical errors—reality itself was inconsistent—and closes the file anyway.

---

## Level 1: One-Paragraph Summary

Years after the Kepler Stopover incident was "closed," a late-career adjuster is assigned to reconcile the files. Multiple agencies—insurance, station authority, transit regulation, labor board—each closed the case differently. Nobody expects new findings; the job is to align paperwork across jurisdictions so everything can be archived before a merger consumes the department. But comparing the agencies' flagged testimonies reveals something stranger than bureaucratic disagreement: twelve testimonies describe mundane details that can't all be true—clocks showing different times simultaneously, hallways measuring different lengths with plans confirming both. The discrepancies aren't errors. Reality was inconsistent. The adjuster—someone who has never needed existential closure, who has spent a career writing reports that make messy things fit—does what they've always done: writes what can be written, leaves out what can't, closes the file, and goes home. The strangeness is that they're not transformed. They just... continue.

## Level 2: Page Summary

### Beat 1: The Reconciliation Assignment

The Kepler Stopover incident was closed years ago—by multiple agencies, each differently. Insurance paid certain claims and denied others. The station authority issued a report. Transit regulation filed their own findings. The labor board documented worker testimonies separately. Now, with a departmental merger looming, someone needs to reconcile these files so they can be archived together. The adjuster—late-career, mixed record, counting months to retirement—gets the job because it's supposed to be easy. A reconciliation audit. Compare documents. Note discrepancies. Recommend a unified archive format. Nobody expects them to investigate anything. They're just supposed to make the paperwork match.

The adjuster is competent but not exceptional. They've handled difficult cases before—fraud they missed, claims they shouldn't have paid. They're not the best closer in the department; they're just available. The Kepler files are thick, tedious, and everyone else is focused on the merger chaos. This is a backwater assignment for someone already on their way out.

### Beat 2: The Uncomfortable Recognition

Working through witness lists, the adjuster encounters a name they recognize. Not someone they loved—someone they knew once and didn't particularly like. A distant connection. A neighbor's ex-husband, maybe. A former colleague from a job they'd rather forget. Someone they'd recognize at a grocery store but wouldn't invite to dinner.

They read this person's testimony. It's ordinary—a traveler describing a routine layover interrupted by whatever happened. But the adjuster can hear their voice in the words. This was a real person. They remember their laugh, their annoying habits, the last awkward conversation they had.

It shouldn't matter. It's not grief. It's not love. But the adjuster finds themselves reading more carefully now. Cross-referencing. Building timelines. Looking for this person's name in other documents. The testimonies become people, not data.

### Beat 3: The Discrepancy Pattern

Comparing flagged testimonies across agencies, the adjuster notices something odd. Each agency flagged different testimonies as problematic. Insurance flagged four. Regulatory flagged five. Station authority flagged three. There's some overlap, but not complete. The total is twelve, but the *reasons* for flagging don't match.

Looking closer, the discrepancies aren't clerical. Testimony #34 says coffee was served at 0700. Testimony #35 says 0702. Both witnesses were looking at the same clock. Both were certain. Cross-referencing physical evidence shows both times are somehow verified—the clock showed different times to different observers, simultaneously.

A hallway measures 12 meters in some testimonies, 15 in others. Architectural plans confirm both measurements. A maintenance log records a repair at Bay 7; another log records the same repair at Bay 9. Physical evidence exists in both locations.

These aren't transcription errors. Reality was inconsistent at the level of coffee times and hallway lengths. The adjuster starts looking at the 488 "ordinary" testimonies and begins noticing smaller discrepancies that nobody else flagged...

### Beat 4: The Quiet Non-Crisis

The adjuster understands what they're seeing. They can't explain it, but they understand it: the Kepler's reality was somehow inconsistent. Multiple true things that can't all be true. The Agreement Problem, if they had to name it.

Here's the thing: they don't need to explain it. They've never needed existential closure. Their job isn't to understand reality—it's to close files. They've spent decades writing reports that make messy, contradictory things fit into forms. This is just... bigger.

Nobody at the department asks questions. Everyone's focused on the merger. The adjuster's supervisor glances at their reconciliation notes, sees "recommend archiving with discrepancy flags," and signs off. No pressure. No cover-up. Just institutional indifference to something that doesn't fit any protocol.

The person they recognized—the one whose testimony they kept reading—is one of the twelve impossibles. Their account describes a hallway that measured both lengths. The adjuster knows this person wasn't lying. They know the testimony is accurate. They know it's impossible. They don't know what to do with that.

### Beat 5: The Procedural Close

The adjuster writes their reconciliation report. They note the discrepancies. They recommend archiving with flags for "unresolved witness variance." They don't explain. They don't expose. They don't disappear into the mystery. They just do the job.

File boxed. Archive stamp. A nod from the archivist who's processed strange files before and doesn't ask questions. Walk to the car. Drive home.

Dinner. Something stupid on TV. The Kepler was today. Tomorrow is something else.

Maybe they'll think about it sometimes. Maybe it'll fade like old cases do. They carry no wisdom, no burden, no secret knowledge. They just closed a file that couldn't quite be closed, and life continued.

The strangeness is that they're not transformed. The cosmic impossibility had no power over them. They're the same person they were before—someone who doesn't need answers, who has never needed answers, who just does the work and goes home.

## Level 3: Act Structure

Based on the deepened direction:

- **Act 1: The Assignment** — Reconciliation audit lands on desk. Merger chaos. Backwater job. The uncomfortable recognition surfaces.
- **Act 2: The Pattern** — Comparing agency files reveals the Agreement Problem. Discrepancies don't resolve. The 488 start showing cracks too.
- **Act 3: The Non-Transformation** — The adjuster understands and doesn't need to act on it. No crisis. No pressure. Just quiet work.
- **Act 4: The Close** — Procedural ending. File archived. Life continues. Anti-climax as the point.

## Thematic Integration

### The Thesis

**Institutional competence creates loneliness.**

The bureaucracy works exactly as designed—it processes the impossible into archive format. The investigator copes because that's what the system teaches. The horror isn't that systems fail; it's that they work so well that humans are isolated inside them.

### How Each Beat Expresses the Thesis

| Beat | Plot Function | Thematic Function |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1: Assignment** | Establishes job and character | Shows institutional competence—the system has a process for everything, including cleanup before mergers |
| **2: Recognition** | Creates personal stakes | Doubles the loneliness—the one person who might understand is gone, and even alive, the relationship was too awkward for connection |
| **3: Discrepancy** | Reveals the impossible | Shows institutional competence extending to the inexplicable—different agencies flagged it differently, but all processed it |
| **4: Non-Crisis** | Anti-transformation | The investigator copes because the system taught them how. Their adequacy is institutional skill. No breakdown = nothing to share. |
| **5: Close** | Procedural ending | System achieves its goal. File archived. The investigator succeeded by institutional metrics. They go home alone. |

### Thematic Justification (replaces "craft freshness")

| Choice | Craft Justification (old) | Thematic Justification (new) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Anti-transformation | Fresher than genre default | System doesn't require transformation. Coping is institutional skill. |
| Institutional indifference | Fresher than antagonist | Indifference is competence. Processing, not attacking. |
| Procedural close | Avoids genre climax | System's goal achieved. Success = isolation. |
| Agreement Problem | Fresh impossibility | Even reality-inconsistency gets processed. The system has categories for the irresolvable. |
| Uncomfortable connection | Creates discomfort | One person who might understand is gone. Relationship too awkward anyway. Doubled loneliness. |

## Proposed Direction Summary

This storyboard proposes a **deeply anti-genre** approach, now with thematic justification:

| Element | Typical Mystery | This Story | Why (Thematic) |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Investigator | Driven seeker | Late-career, clearing desk | Institutional competence doesn't require drive—just processing |
| Institution | Antagonist covering up | Indifferent, focused elsewhere | Competent systems don't need to be hostile—they just absorb |
| Arc | Transformation through discovery | No transformation—same person after | Coping is the skill the system taught. Nothing to share. |
| Personal connection | Lost loved one | Awkward acquaintance they didn't like | Even potential connection was too awkward. Doubled loneliness. |
| Evidence | 12 curated clues | Fragmented agency flags, incomplete | Different agencies processed differently. All competently. |
| Ending | Revelation/choice/sacrifice | Procedural close, dinner, TV | The system's goal is achieved. That's the horror. |

**Why this works (thematic):**
- Expresses the truth that institutional competence isolates
- Shows how systems absorb the impossible without breaking
- The investigator's adequacy is enabled by—and costs—connection
- Readers experience institutional processing through narrative form
- "All are true" hits hardest when it gets filed correctly anyway

## Open Questions for Development

### Now Decided (Proposed)
- **Investigator type**: Late-career adjuster, reconciliation audit specialist
- **Institution stance**: Indifferent, not hostile—focused on merger
- **Arc shape**: Anti-transformation; same person before and after
- **Personal connection**: Distant, uncomfortable acquaintance
- **Ending direction**: Procedural close, life continues

### Still Open
1. **Investigator specifics**: Name, exact role, which agency
2. **The merger**: What agencies are merging? Why does this create the reconciliation audit?
3. **The uncomfortable acquaintance**: Who specifically? What was the relationship?
4. **The archivist**: Character or just a moment? Do they know something?
5. **Kepler specifics**: Location, how long ago, what "vanished" means exactly
6. **Testimony integration**: Which of the 12 impossible testimonies appear as scenes vs. summary?
7. **The 488**: What additional discrepancies does the adjuster find?
