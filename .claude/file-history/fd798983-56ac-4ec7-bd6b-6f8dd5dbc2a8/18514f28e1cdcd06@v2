# Plot Arc Brainstorm: The Kepler Testimonies

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Method:** Escape Velocity Protocol (brainstorming skill)
**Focus:** Shape of investigation, 12 testimony structure, investigator arc resolution

---

## Phase 1: Defaults Enumerated

Before generating divergent options, explicitly naming what "anyone" would suggest:

### Investigation Shape Defaults
1. **Linear Discovery** - Investigator finds clues in order, building toward revelation
2. **Conspiracy Layers** - Each answer reveals bigger conspiracy; rabbit hole deepens
3. **Red Herrings + True Path** - False leads until real pattern emerges
4. **The Reveal Twist** - Everything recontextualizes at the end
5. **Mounting Dread** - Atmosphere thickens as we approach truth

### Investigator Arc Defaults
1. **Skeptic → Believer** - Starts dismissive, ends convinced
2. **Outsider → Insider Knowledge** - Learns what "they" don't want known
3. **Damaged Protagonist Seeks Redemption** - Personal flaw overcome
4. **Corruption Arc** - Starts idealistic, ends compromised
5. **Sacrifice for Truth** - Gives up everything to expose the lie

### Ending Defaults
1. **Blow the Whistle** - Truth goes public
2. **Pyrrhic Victory** - Truth exposed but investigator destroyed
3. **Ambiguous/Open** - Some answers, deeper mystery remains
4. **Join the Conspiracy** - Understand why, become part of it
5. **Truth Changes Nothing** - Exposed but nobody cares

### 12 Testimonies Placement Defaults
1. **Spaced Throughout** - One per section, building
2. **Clustered Revelation** - Found all at once = turning point
3. **Known Early, Understood Late** - Reader sees before investigator grasps
4. **Hidden Until Climax** - Withheld for maximum impact

**Pattern identified:** All defaults share structure where investigation is about FINDING hidden truth, moving toward REVELATION. Investigator = SEEKER, truth = PRIZE, institution = OBSTACLE.

## Phase 2: Function Extraction

What must the plot arc actually accomplish?

| Assumed Form | Actual Function |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Investigation discovers truth" | **F1:** Reader EXPERIENCES the strangeness of the Agreement Problem |
| "Investigator transformation" | **F2:** Emotional journey that makes us CARE about impossible physics |
| "Institutional antagonist" | **F3:** Stakes and tension justifying the length |
| "Resolution/ending" | **F4:** Satisfying conclusion that HONORS "all are true" without explaining away |
| "12 testimonies as evidence" | **F5:** STRUCTURE reading experience; manage information revelation |
| "Personal connection" | **F6:** Ground cosmic impossibility in HUMAN relationship |

---

## Phase 3: Axis Mapping

| Axis | Default | Alternatives |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Who drives plot?** | Investigator discovers | Testimonies drive it? Institution drives it? Witnesses drive it? Reader assembles it? |
| **Shape of revelation?** | Linear accumulation → climax | Circular? Spiral? Fragmented? Inverted (we know, they don't)? |
| **Nature of stakes?** | Career/truth/exposure | Sanity? Reality? Past? Whether case closes? |
| **Relationship to impossibility?** | Mystery to solve | Weather to survive? Lens to see through? Infection? Language? |

---

## Phase 4: Entropy Constraints Applied

**Actor Inversions:**
- Investigator already a believer, not skeptic
- Institution doesn't understand (not hiding)
- Personal connection came back *different*

**Structure Inversions:**
- Start WITH 12 impossibilities; plot is about failing to explain
- Investigation makes things WORSE
- Closing the file is RIGHT thing to do

**Stakes Inversions:**
- Truth is USELESS, not dangerous
- Exposure wouldn't matter; reality moved on
- Soul at stake, not career

---

## Divergent Options Generated

### OPTION A: The Cataloguer

**Shape:** Investigator starts KNOWING impossibility; tries to CONTAIN it, not reveal it.

A professional "closer" who's handled anomalies before. Job is writing reports that make impossible things fit frameworks. They're good at it. This case should be routine.

But the Agreement Problem resists their methods. Every framework (instrument error, witness contamination, mass delusion) fails. Arc isn't skeptic→believer, it's **competent→humbled**.

**Personal connection:** Someone whose testimony IS one of the 12 impossible. Investigator KNOWS them well enough to know they're not lying. Not "I must find what happened to my friend" - it's "I know she's telling the truth and can't make it fit reality."

**Ending direction:** Learn to write a report that tells truth by telling a story no one will believe. Truth hidden in plain sight, in a file that reads as fiction.

**Axes rotated:** WHO (expert, not outsider), REVELATION (containment fails vs. discovery succeeds), RELATIONSHIP (problem to contain)

---

### OPTION B: The Congregation

**Shape:** Investigation isn't one person - it's the 500 witnesses trying to understand what happened to THEM.

Multiple testimony-givers in months after return. Trying to resume normal lives, can't. Find each other - support groups, forums, chance encounters. Investigation is collective, fractured, unreliable.

The 12 impossible testimonies are people who remember differently - but not special. Just ones whose memories CONFLICT most obviously. Agreement Problem affects everyone; some notice sooner.

**Investigator role:** A reporter, researcher, or AI correlating testimonies. Their perspective is one of many, not center.

**Structure:** Polyphonic. Multiple POVs. Reader assembles understanding from fragments.

**Ending direction:** Witnesses find peace not by understanding, but by creating shared narrative holding contradictions. New community. Or: can't reconcile, slowly drift apart.

**Axes rotated:** WHO (collective, not individual), STAKES (community/belonging), RELATIONSHIP (shared trauma to process)

---

### OPTION C: The Procedural

**Shape:** The impossibility isn't the point. The bureaucracy is.

Lean into institutional realism. Filing paperwork, attending meetings, budget constraints, office politics. Kepler case is one of 47 open files. Agreement Problem is a footnote problem - literally, how to footnote contradictory testimony in regulatory report.

Cosmic strangeness becomes **ambient**. Everyone knows it's there. Nobody knows what to do with it. Institution doesn't cover up maliciously - they cover up because they have no protocol for inconsistent reality. What box do you check?

**12 testimonies:** Appear as formatting problems. #34 and #35 can't both be footnoted as "verified" (contradict each other), can't be marked "disputed" (both true). Chapters spent solving this as document management.

**Ending direction:** Bureaucratic workaround - a form, procedure, loophole that lets file close without lying. Impossibility is processed. Nothing explained. Everything filed. Life continues.

**Axes rotated:** WHO (institution is ambient force), STAKES (mundane - paperwork), RELATIONSHIP (formatting problem)

---

### OPTION D: The Recurrence

**Shape:** The investigator has done this before. They don't remember.

Novel begins with receiving Kepler file. Routine. But reading testimonies, déjà vu. Not "feels familiar" but "I've read Testimony #47 before." Notes in their own handwriting in file margins. Previous investigation - their own - they don't remember.

Agreement Problem isn't just in testimonies. It's in investigator. They've been here before. Maybe multiple times. Their own timeline is inconsistent.

**Personal connection:** The person they recognize is... themselves. A testimony from someone with their name, background, handwriting. But they were never on the Kepler. Were they?

**Structure:** Archaeological - digging through layers of their own forgotten work. Each layer reveals more, but also more about how many times they've tried and failed.

**Ending direction:** Realize they're in loop but can't escape. Or: find what previous versions were too afraid to see. Or: write message to next version of themselves.

**Axes rotated:** WHO (timeline itself), REVELATION (recursive/looping), STAKES (sanity/identity), RELATIONSHIP (experienced firsthand)

---

### OPTION E: The Acceptance

**Shape:** Arc is learning to LIVE with impossibility, not resolve it.

Start as someone needing answers. End learning some questions don't have answers, and that's okay. Agreement Problem isn't mystery to solve - it's a condition of reality at the Kepler. Maybe everywhere; we just don't notice.

Institutional pressure isn't villainous - it's compassionate. "Let it go. You'll make yourself crazy. Nobody needs to know. Nobody CAN know. Close the file. Live your life."

**12 testimonies:** Each is meditation on limits of knowledge. Not clues but koans. Investigator reads, re-reads, stops trying to reconcile.

**Personal connection:** Someone already at peace with not knowing. A witness who says "I stopped trying to understand. I just remember what I remember. Doesn't have to make sense."

**Ending direction:** Closes file. Not as cover-up, but as acceptance. Some things don't fit reports. Carry it silently. Continue living.

**Axes rotated:** WHO (witness wisdom drives), REVELATION (anti-revelation), STAKES (soul/peace), RELATIONSHIP (condition to accept)

## Phase 5: Orthogonality Audit

| Option | Who Drives | Revelation Shape | Stakes | Relationship to Impossibility |
|--------|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **A: Cataloguer** | Investigator (expert) | Inverted (containment fails) | Professional identity | Problem to contain |
| **B: Congregation** | Witnesses (collective) | Fragmented/polyphonic | Community/belonging | Shared trauma |
| **C: Procedural** | Institution (ambient) | Ambient (always present) | Mundane (paperwork) | Formatting problem |
| **D: Recurrence** | Timeline (mysterious) | Recursive/looping | Sanity/identity | Experienced firsthand |
| **E: Acceptance** | Witness wisdom | Anti-revelation | Soul/peace | Condition to accept |

**Assessment:** These span genuinely different axes. Not variations of "investigator finds truth" - different approaches to what the story IS.

---

## Possible Combinations

These elements can be mixed:

- **A + C:** Expert cataloguer in procedural bureaucracy - containment IS the paperwork problem
- **B + E:** Collective witnesses finding acceptance together - polyphonic peace
- **D + A:** Looping cataloguer who keeps failing to contain, layer after layer
- **C + E:** Procedural acceptance - the system learns to file impossibility without explaining
- **B + D:** Multiple POVs realize they're all in loops; their testimonies are from different iterations

## Taste Alignment Check

Per `context/foundation/taste.md` (Jon's preferences):
- **Competent people facing real constraints** ✓ Options A, C strongly
- **Real institutional complexity** ✓ Option C especially
- **Grounded worldbuilding** ✓ Options A, C, E
- **Not "lone hero vs. stupid system"** ✓ Options B, C, E avoid this
- **Show how cover-ups actually work** ✓ Option C

**Risky for taste:** Option D (Recurrence) could feel too supernatural/genre. Needs grounding.

---

## Next Steps

1. Community input on which directions resonate
2. Possibly combine elements from multiple options
3. Develop chosen direction(s) to Level 3 (Act Structure)
