# Project Definition

## Purpose
The Kepler Testimonies is an experimental collaborative fiction project exploring a new model for AI-assisted storytelling.

## The Model
- **AI Team**: Claude Opus + custom fiction skills/frameworks does the heavy lifting of drafting
- **Human Role**: Producers/directors who vote on key decisions
- **Transparency**: Full history visible - all session logs, drafts, dead ends, and revisions

## Goals
1. Produce a complete novel through AI+human collaboration
2. Make the entire creative process public and transparent
3. Experiment with community-driven narrative decisions
4. Demonstrate effective use of AI fiction frameworks

## Origin
Started as a [Threads post](https://www.threads.com/@jwynia/post/DS8sAi1jTX3) asking if anyone would participate in a public AI fiction experiment. The community chose the premise through voting.

## Relationship Network
