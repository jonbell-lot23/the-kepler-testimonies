# The Kepler Testimonies: Storyboard

This document uses the **snowflake method**—each level expands the previous with more detail. Levels 0-2 are pre-populated from locked foundation decisions. Level 3+ will be developed through skill-assisted iteration.

---

## Level 0: One-Sentence Summary

An investigator assigned to close the file on a vanished waystation discovers that 12 of the 500 collected testimonies contain mundane details that cannot all be true—and that powerful interests want this buried.

---

## Level 1: One-Paragraph Summary

A bureaucratic investigator receives a routine assignment: write the final report on the Kepler Stopover incident, a deep-space waystation that vanished with 500 people aboard and reappeared (or was found) some time later. All 500 gave testimonies. 488 are ordinary—travelers, staff, cargo haulers describing a routine day interrupted. But as the investigator works through them, they discover someone aboard they knew personally, transforming the assignment into something they can't just sign off on. Digging deeper, they find 12 testimonies that describe trivial details impossibly: clocks showing different times to different observers, hallways measuring different lengths with architectural plans confirming both, the same repair logged in two locations with physical evidence in each. The contradictions are undeniable, but the investigator's institution—whatever agency owns this file—pushes for a cover story. The investigator must decide: comply with the comfortable lie, expose the impossible truth, or disappear into the mystery themselves.

## Level 2: Page Summary

### Beat 1: The Assignment

The investigator works for an agency that handles incident closure—insurance, liability, regulatory sign-off, something institutional and unglamorous. The Kepler Stopover case lands on their desk not because it's important, but because it's been sitting too long. Someone needs to stamp it closed. The file is thick: 500 testimonies, station logs, forensic reports, insurance claims. The investigator is competent, experienced, and initially treats this as paperwork. The Kepler was a deep-space waystation—a refueling depot on a transit route. Not a research vessel, not a colony ship. Just infrastructure. The people aboard were random: travelers, station staff, families in transit, cargo haulers on layover. They vanished. They came back (or were found). Everyone gave testimony. Case should be straightforward.

### Beat 2: The Personal Connection

Working through testimonies, the investigator encounters a name they recognize. Someone they knew—a friend, a family member, a former colleague, an ex-partner, someone significant. This person was aboard the Kepler. Their testimony is in the file. Reading it changes the assignment's weight. This isn't just paperwork anymore. The investigator starts reading more carefully, looking for details about this person's experience, how they ended up at the Stopover, what they witnessed. The testimonies become people, not data. The investigator begins cross-referencing, building timelines, mapping who was where. Patterns emerge that don't quite fit.

### Beat 3: The Agreement Problem Emerges

Initially, small discrepancies look like transcription errors or memory failures. Normal stuff—witnesses disagree about details all the time. But these don't resolve. The investigator finds Testimony #34 stating coffee was served at 0700, Testimony #35 stating 0702, both witnesses looking at the same clock, both certain. Cross-reference shows both were truthful—the clock showed different times simultaneously. A hallway measures 12 meters in some testimonies, 15 in others. Architectural plans confirm both measurements. A maintenance log records a repair at Bay 7; another records the same repair at Bay 9. Physical evidence exists in both locations.

Twelve testimonies contain details like this. Not dramatic contradictions—mundane ones. Coffee times, hallway lengths, repair locations. Reality was inconsistent at the level of minutiae. The investigator can't explain it. More troubling: these testimonies are otherwise completely credible. The witnesses aren't confused or unreliable. They're describing exactly what they experienced. And what they experienced was impossible.

### Beat 4: Institutional Pressure

The investigator's superiors notice they're taking too long on a routine close-out. Questions arise. The investigator raises the discrepancies; they're told to note them as data collection errors and move on. This is standard—acknowledge anomalies, attribute to mundane causes, close the file. But the investigator has seen the physical evidence. They know these aren't errors. Someone above them knows too, or suspects. The pressure to sign off increases. A cover story is suggested—something about instrument calibration, testimony contamination, the usual bureaucratic smoothing. The institution doesn't want impossible conclusions in a final report. Impossible conclusions create liability, scrutiny, questions nobody wants answered.

### Beat 5: The Choice (Resolution Open)

The investigator faces a fork:

- **Comply**: Sign the cover story, close the file, move on. Career survives. Truth dies in a filing cabinet.
- **Expose**: Document everything, refuse to sign, blow the whistle. Career probably ends. Truth becomes public. Consequences unknown—for the investigator, for the institution, for what the truth means about reality.
- **Disappear**: Go looking for answers themselves. Follow the threads the institution wants buried. Find out what really happened at the Kepler. Risk becoming the next case file someone has to close.
- **Something else**: The ending remains open for development through community input and skill-assisted exploration.

## Level 3: Act Structure

*To be developed using `/outline-collaborator`*

Placeholder structure based on the 4-phase investigator arc:

- **Act 1**: Assignment + Personal Connection discovered
- **Act 2**: Agreement Problem investigation + accumulating impossibility
- **Act 3**: Institutional pressure + forced choice
- **Act 4**: Resolution (outcome TBD)

---

## Level 4: Sequence Breakdown

*To be developed after Act Structure is established*

---

## Level 5+: Scene Beats

*To be developed after Sequence Breakdown*

---

## Open Questions for Development

Carried forward from Decision 003:

1. **Investigator specifics**: Role, agency, disposition, name, background
2. **Personal connection**: Who was aboard that matters to them? Relationship type?
3. **The institution**: What agency? What's their stake in the cover-up? Why suppress?
4. **Kepler specifics**: Location in space, how long ago it vanished, what "vanished" means exactly, how testimonies were collected
5. **The ending**: Which resolution path, and what does it mean?
6. **Testimony integration**: How are specific testimonies woven into the investigation narrative? Which of the 12 impossible ones appear as scenes?
