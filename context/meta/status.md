# Current Project Status

## Last Updated
2026-01-12

## State
**Outline Development In Progress** - Storyboard created with Levels 0-2 pre-populated from foundation decisions. Snowflake method adopted for iterative expansion. CLAUDE.md updated with automatic skill invocation for outline work.

## What Exists
- Locked premise: "500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true."
- Project structure and context network
- **Story development structure** - Full outline skeleton with meta, outline, elements, and craft sections
- **Storyboard (Levels 0-2)** - High-level arc established ([storyboard.md](../story/outline/storyboard.md))
- **Snowflake workflow** - Expansion process documented ([snowflake-workflow.md](../story/outline/snowflake-workflow.md))
- **Automatic skill invocation** - CLAUDE.md configured for skill triggers during outline work
- Community participation channels (GitHub Discussions)
- Foundation documents for creative taste and success criteria
- Concept brainstorm with voting options ([concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md](../story/concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md))
- **Foundation decisions resolved:**
  - **Vessel Type**: The Stopover (deep-space waystation)
  - **Impossibility Type**: The Agreement Problem (mundane details that can't all be true)
  - **Structure**: Investigation-driven narrative (NOT testimony catalog)
  - **Investigator Arc**: Bureaucratic assignment → personal connection → evidence won't fit → institutional pressure

## What's Next
1. ~~Community votes on Kepler type + impossibility mechanism~~ Resolved (tied votes, Director decision)
2. ~~Begin outline development~~ Storyboard L0-L2 complete
3. **Expand storyboard to Level 3** (Act Structure) using `/outline-collaborator`
4. Develop investigator character specifics (name, role, agency)
5. Design testimony integration—which of the 12 impossible testimonies appear when
6. Answer open questions: personal connection, institution, ending

## Decision Status

### Open Questions for Outline Development
- **Who is the investigator?** Role, agency, disposition
- **What's the personal connection?** Who was aboard that matters to them
- **What's the institution?** What agency, what cover story, why suppress
- **What's the ending?** Comply, expose, disappear, or something else
- **The Kepler station**: Location, how long ago, what "vanished" means

### Recently Resolved
- **Decision 003**: Foundation choices → Stopover + Agreement Problem + Investigation structure (Director decision, tie-breaker)
- **Decision 002**: Governance adoption → Formal governance framework implemented
- **Decision 001**: Premise selection → THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected

## Recent Activity

### 2026-01-12
- **Storyboard initiated** - Snowflake outlining approach adopted
  - Created `storyboard.md` with Levels 0-2 pre-populated from foundation decisions
  - Level 0: One-sentence premise
  - Level 1: One-paragraph summary (5 beats)
  - Level 2: Page summary expanding each beat
  - Levels 3+ to be developed via skill-assisted expansion
- **Snowflake workflow documented** - `snowflake-workflow.md` explains expansion process
- **CLAUDE.md enhanced** - Added Skill Preferences and Automatic Skill Invocation sections
  - Skills now trigger automatically from natural language ("expand this" → `/outline-collaborator`)
  - Organized by domain: Outlining, Ideation, Development, Drafting
- **Branch created**: `feature/storyboard-outline` for PR review

### 2026-01-08
- **Foundation decisions resolved** - Director decision broke tied community votes
  - Vessel: The Stopover (waystation on transit route)
  - Impossibility: The Agreement Problem (mundane details inconsistent)
  - Structure: Investigation-driven (protagonist investigator, not testimony catalog)
  - Arc: Four phases (assignment → personal connection → evidence won't fit → pressure)
- Decision record created: [003-foundation-choices.md](../decisions/003-foundation-choices.md)
- Ready for outline development

### 2026-01-03
- **Outline structure implemented** - Adopted organizational system from another project
  - `story/meta/` - Tagline, premise, synopsis (premise moved from foundation/)
  - `story/outline/` - Structure overview, backlog, issues tracking
  - `story/elements/` - Characters, places, organizations, objects
  - `story/craft/` - Voice decisions, writing choices log
  - `foundation/outline-workflow.md` - System documentation
- **Backlog system ready** - Priority-based issue tracking for story problems
- **Navigation updated** - discovery.md and story/index.md now reflect new structure
### 2026-01-02
- **Foundation documents established** - Created taste.md and ideal-state.md
  - Individual taste entries framework (Director example included)
  - Forced tradeoffs section for explicit creative direction
  - Success criteria and deliverables defined
  - Changelog approach established
  - Both integrated into onboarding workflow
- **Polls created via web UI** - GitHub Discussions polls require manual creation through the web interface (API doesn't support poll options); original emoji-reaction polls and API-created discussions closed
- **Voting format established** - all polls include "none of these" with space for suggestions
- **Cliché transcendence completed** - all moderate-risk options freshened
  - "Embassy" → "Failed Mission" (decommissioning crew, contact arrives while closing)
  - "Witness Problem" → "Absent Witnesses" (people with alibis who were never aboard)
  - "Mutual Exclusion" → "Agreement Problem" (trivial details inconsistent, not dramatic events)
  - "The Chorus" replaced with "The Stopover" (flagged as fantasy/magic)

### 2026-01-01
- **Concept brainstorm completed** using Escape Velocity Protocol
  - 3 options for "What is the Kepler?" (now: Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
  - 3 options for "Impossibility mechanism" (now: Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)
  - Options verified as genuinely divergent (different axes, not variations)
- GitHub workflow documented (branches, PRs, issues, gh CLI)
- Context network initialized
- Foundation documents created
- Decision record for premise selection documented

### December 2025
- Project created after Threads interest check
- Community voted on premise
- THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected

## Blockers
None currently.

## Open Questions
- ~~What is the Kepler?~~ → **RESOLVED**: The Stopover (waystation)
- ~~What makes 12 testimonies "impossible"?~~ → **RESOLVED**: The Agreement Problem (mundane inconsistencies)
- ~~How to structure 500 testimonies for reading/presentation?~~ → **RESOLVED**: Investigation-driven narrative
- Who is the investigator? (role, agency, disposition)
- What's the personal connection? (who was aboard that matters to them)
- What's the institution? (what agency, what cover story, why suppress)
- What's the ending? (comply, expose, disappear, or something else)
- What does "vanished" mean exactly? How long ago? Did it reappear?
