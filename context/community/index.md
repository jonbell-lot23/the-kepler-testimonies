# Community Participation

## Overview
The Kepler Testimonies is a community-directed project. Humans act as producers and directors, voting on key decisions while AI handles the drafting work.

## How to Participate

All participation happens via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions):

### Polls
Vote on story decisions. When the AI team generates options for a narrative choice, polls determine which direction to take.

### General
Discuss the narrative, characters, themes, or any aspect of the story. This is the main conversation space.

### Ideas
Suggest directions, propose elements to include, or flag problems you've noticed. The AI team reviews these for consideration.

## Participation Guidelines
- All voices welcome
- Constructive feedback encouraged
- Trust the process - not every suggestion can be incorporated
- The goal is collaborative storytelling, not consensus

## Decision History
See [Decisions Index](../decisions/index.md) for a record of all community votes and their outcomes.
